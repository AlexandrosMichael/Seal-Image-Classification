# Classification of Seal Images - Logistic Regression


## Virtual environment


Create a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv virtualenv
```

Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source virtualenv/bin/activate
```

## Installation

Installing all the pip packages

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Jupyter Notebook

The program for this assignment was developed using a Jupyter Notebook. To run the notebook, enter the following in the command line:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

The "Binary Classification.ipynb" notebook implements the classifiers for the binary classification task and the "Multiclass Classification.ipynb" notebook implements the classifiers for the multi-class classification task. 


## Python Scripts

Within the submission, I have also included Python script counterparts of the notebooks. These can be run as any other python scripts. 

Binary classification
```bash
python3 BinaryClassification.py
```

## Plots
I have saved copies of the graphical representations I have created for the purposes of this assignment within the plots directory.

## Results
I have included text files containing the classification reports for every single experiment carried out as part of this assignment. These can be found in the results directory. 

## Y_test.csv
As required, I've created a .csv file for each of the classification tasks, which contains the predictions of my best performing classifiers on the two X_test.csv datasets supplied. These can be found in the data directory.
